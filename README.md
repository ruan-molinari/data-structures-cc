# data-structures-cc

This is a study project where I implement some data structures in C++.
The intent is to learn about data structures, and memory management, and C++.

Feel free to use any code here for anything, although I would recommend so, for there are plenty of mature libraries that do the same. C++ std library will cover most use cases here presented.
